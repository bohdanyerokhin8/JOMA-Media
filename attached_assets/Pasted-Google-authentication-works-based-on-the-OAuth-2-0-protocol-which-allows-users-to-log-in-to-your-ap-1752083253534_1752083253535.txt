Google authentication works based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows users to log in to your app using their Google account securely without sharing their password with your app. Here is the principle and flow of how it works:

Principle of Google Authentication (OAuth 2.0 Flow)
User Initiates Login:
Your app provides a "Sign in with Google" button or link. When the user clicks it, your app redirects them to Google's login page.

User Authenticates with Google:
The user enters their Google credentials on Google's secure login page. Your app never sees the password.

Google Asks for Consent:
Google asks the user to consent to share certain information (scopes) with your app, such as email, profile info, etc.

Google Redirects Back to Your App:
After successful login and consent, Google redirects the user back to your app at a predefined redirect URI with an authorization code.

Your App Exchanges Code for Tokens:
Your backend sends this authorization code to Google’s token endpoint to exchange it for an access token (and optionally a refresh token).

Access User Info:
Using the access token, your app can call Google APIs to get user profile information (email, name, picture) or access other authorized Google services.

User is Logged In:
Your app creates a session or token for the user, so they remain logged in without needing to re-authenticate immediately.

Key Concepts
OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that lets apps access user data without handling passwords.

Scopes: Permissions your app requests (e.g., openid, email, profile).

Redirect URI: URL in your app where Google sends the user after login.

Access Token: Token your app uses to access Google APIs on behalf of the user.

ID Token: Contains user identity information in OpenID Connect (an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0).

Example Workflow in a Web App (e.g., Flask on Replit)
User clicks "Sign in with Google" → app redirects to Google login URL.

Google authenticates user → redirects back to /oauth2callback with a code.

App exchanges code for access token.

App fetches user info from Google API.

App creates session and shows user info.

Summary
Step	Description
User clicks login	Redirect to Google’s OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint
User logs in & consents	Google authenticates and asks for permissions
Redirect back to app	Google sends authorization code to your redirect URI
Exchange code for tokens	Your app requests access token from Google
Access user info	Use token to get user profile and other authorized data
User logged in	Create session or token in your app
This flow ensures secure authentication without your app ever handling user passwords, relying on Google’s trusted login system.
