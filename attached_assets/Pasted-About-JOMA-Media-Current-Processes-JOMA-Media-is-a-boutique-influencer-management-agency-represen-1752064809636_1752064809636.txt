About JOMA Media & Current Processes: JOMA Media is a boutique influencer‑management agency representing a curated roster of creators across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Today the team relies on spreadsheets, make.com, n8n, and manual PDF invoices to: (1) vet and onboard new influencers, (2) shortlist talent for inbound brand briefs, (3) track content deliveries and approvals, and (4) reconcile payments. These fragmented tools limit visibility, introduce errors, and cap JOMA’s campaign capacity. Digitising the entire "match → deliver → invoice" loop inside a single web app will shorten deal cycles, give influencers on‑demand insight into their earnings, and let JOMA scale its operations without increasing headcount.
This SOW defines the work required to deliver an MVP web application that connects JOMA Media and its managed influencers with businesses seeking collaborative campaigns. The MVP will:
provide a friction‑free onboarding path for influencers,


enable JOMA admins to search and shortlist influencers,


let influencers submit payment requests with proof of work, and


surface basic earnings analytics for influencers.


The MVP is intentionally narrow: it proves the end‑to‑end “match → deliver → invoice” loop before scaling to a full multi‑sided super app.
Context for Developers: This MVP forms the foundation of a larger “digital super app” that will ultimately serve creators, small‑business owners, and anyone interested in the digital economy with community, learning, and commerce tools. Your mandate in this first iteration is to deliver a lean, reliable matchmaking workflow—sign‑up, search, job tracking, and payment requests—so we can validate demand, gather real‑world data, and iterate quickly before layering on AI recommendations, brand portals, and native mobile clients.

Assumptions & Constraints
MVP supports one admin role and influencer self‑service; Only 2 roles needed. 


Third‑party payment gateway integration is out‑of‑scope; invoices are uploaded files.


AI‑based matching will be explored post‑MVP and is excluded from this SOW.


Scope changes trigger a formal change‑request and re‑estimation.
UX/UI design will be generated by AI or used from an open source library.
